# Roadmap

**Status:** revised 2026-10-03 after the owner's review of the beta (M8 added as Craft); M8
built 2026-10-04; revised 2026-10-04 for the owner's redesign brief: M9 is the Redesign
(planned, awaiting the owner's approval), with tablets and phones folded into it, and the former
M9 "Ecosystem" is now M10. Milestones are ordered by
dependency, not by calendar. We ship when a milestone's exit criteria pass, not on a date.
Versions follow SemVer and ADR-0017: M1–M5 were internal (0.1–0.5, never published); the
first public release is `1.0.0-beta.0` at the end of M7, and `1.0.0` only when the exit
criteria at the end of this document pass.

Legend for engine columns: **P** = PDFium (EmbedPDF engines), **L** = @cantoo/pdf-lib,
**Q** = qpdf-wasm, **T** = tesseract.js, **own** = our own code on top.

## M0 — Foundation (no user-visible features) — **done 2026-09-27**

Goal: a repository a Microsoft/Google-grade team would be comfortable contributing to.

- Repository scaffolding: Vite 8, TypeScript 7 strict, React 19, ESLint 10 flat config +
  typescript-eslint, Biome formatter, lefthook + commitlint (Conventional Commits),
  Changesets, Renovate, EditorConfig, CODEOWNERS, issue/PR templates.
- CI: lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, Playwright smoke on three browsers; deploy to
  GitHub Pages from `main`; preview build artifact on PRs.
- Engine abstraction layer (`packages/engine`): `PdfRenderer`, `PdfEditor`,
  `PdfAssembler`, `PdfPlumber` interfaces; PDFium worker with Comlink; pdf-lib assembly
  worker. qpdf is integrated in M3 (ADR-0008).
- Test corpus (`test/fixtures/`) with provenance notes and licenses for every file.
- Design tokens and the base UI shell (app frame, panels, command palette skeleton).
- Docs: this set, plus `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

Exit: `pnpm run ci` green; a page from a dropped PDF renders in the shell; deploy works.
Status: all three met except the first production deploy, which needs GitHub Pages enabled
on the repository and a merge to `main` (owner action).

## M1 — Light table and structural editing  (→ 0.1, internal) — **done 2026-09-27**

The mandatory feature: merge many PDFs with drag-and-drop reordering.

Status as of 2026-09-27 (legend: **done**, **partial** with what is missing).

| Feature | Engine | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open many files (picker, drop, folder drop) | own | three-tier input path; PNG/JPEG/WebP accepted too | done |
| Tabs per document; light table view of any set of documents | own | pin via tab menu, tab drag, "Show all" | done |
| Thumbnail grid, virtualized, adjustable size | P | cached bitmaps; image pages drawn from their blobs | done |
| Select (click, shift, marquee), drag between documents, insertion indicator | own | pragmatic-dnd; keyboard alternative (cut/paste, Alt+Arrows) | done |
| Reorder, delete, duplicate, rotate, reverse, interleave (odd/even, duplex) | own | virtual model; Interleave dialog previews the first 6 pages | done |
| Split: by ranges, every N, by outline, extract selection to new tab | own | Split dialog (every N, typed ranges with inline errors, top-level bookmarks, before selected pages); "Move / Copy to new document" | partial: only top-level bookmarks cut (no deeper outline level); split titles by bookmark only in outline mode |
| Merge: into another document, all open documents | own | section/tab menu "Merge into…" (submenu of documents); "Merge all open documents" with reorderable order and title | done |
| Rename documents | own | in place in tab or section header (double-click, F2, menus), validated | done |
| Insert blank page, insert images as pages (JPEG/PNG/WebP) | L | blank size follows the preceding page; images at 72 dpi, "Fit to A4 width" or "Original size"; WebP re-encoded to PNG, JPEG passed through; a drop onto a section is one undo step | partial: EXIF orientation of JPEGs is not applied in the PDF; no GIF/HEIC |
| Export with outline/link/label/AcroForm reconciliation | L + own | the correctness core; image pages get their blobs | done (engine warnings in the summary are English only) |
| Verification pass before download | P | | done |
| Undo/redo with history panel | own | every section operation is one labelled history entry | done |
| Command palette, shortcuts, `?` overlay | own | section operations in the "Documents" group; F2 renames | done |
| Privacy indicator, offline PWA | own | | done |
| English and Turkish UI | own | Paraglide catalogs; palette groups re-register on language change | done |
| Form-widget warning badge on duplicated pages (spec §5) | own | needs the per-page form policy (M3) | not started |

Exit: the five-file merge scenario in `VISION.md` passes with golden-file tests
(`packages/engine/test/merge-golden.test.ts`, six corpus files) — met. The UI flow (drop,
Merge all, export, page count checked with pdf-lib) is covered by
`apps/web/e2e/light-table.spec.ts`.

## M2 — Viewer and annotations  (→ 0.2, internal) — **done 2026-09-27**

| Feature | Engine | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Continuous virtualized page view, zoom (fit, width, %), rotation view | P | plus single-page and two-up layouts; pointer-anchored pinch and Mod+wheel zoom; tiles above 16 MP | done |
| Text selection from glyph geometry, copy, search across pages | P | text layer per run mapped through page frame (CropBox origin, rotation); streamed search with match offsets | done (one stretched span per run; approximate for unusual fonts) |
| Outline panel, page labels shown, go-to-page, remembered position | P + own | authored open state; Mod+G accepts labels | done |
| Highlight / underline / strikeout from selection (QuadPoints) | P | squiggly too; merged per line, order verified in saved bytes | done |
| Ink, shapes (rect, ellipse, line, arrow), free text, sticky notes | P | arrows via line endings; notes with popups written at save; free text limited to WinAnsi characters with standard fonts | partial: no embedded Inter font for free text; each ink stroke is its own annotation |
| Image stamp, signature (draw / type / image), clearly labeled as not cryptographic | P | built-in DRAFT / APPROVED / CONFIDENTIAL text stamps | partial: stamp opacity only via post-pass |
| Contextual floating toolbar for the selection; properties panel | own | 8 swatches + custom, opacity, stroke, font size, comment | done (no arrow-key nudging; multi-select within one page) |
| Flatten annotations on export (optional) | P | plus include-comments toggle; conformance check in verification | done |
| Comments panel | own | by page, author setting | done |

Exit: annotations created here render correctly in two independent renderers, our PDFium
build (Chrome-class viewers) and pdf.js (Firefox), checked headlessly by the automated
matrix (`pnpm --filter @pdf-editor/qa-tool matrix`, results and contact sheets in
`docs/qa/annotations-matrix.md`); Acrobat, Preview and Edge have an optional five-minute
spot check (owner decision, `DISCUSSION.md` #13). Structural conformance (AP, Rect,
QuadPoints, /P, /NM, Print flag, opacity ExtGState, Multiply blend) is asserted
automatically on every export. Open at the time of writing: pdf.js drew a second, black
underline under our links (missing `/C`); the engine fix is in progress.

Known engine behaviours to keep in mind (from the M2 correctness review; tracked as
follow-ups, not blockers):

- EmbedPDF regenerates the page content stream on every annotation update, so an edited
  source is exported through PDFium's re-serialization rather than byte-preserved.
- Reading annotations assigns a `/NM` to any annotation that lacks one; edited sources
  therefore leave with ids on annotations that had none.
- Undoing a delete or update of an annotation that came with the file rebuilds it from our
  mapping and regenerates its appearance; custom appearances, rich text and unmapped keys
  are not restored. Annotations created in the app round-trip exactly.
- Free text is limited to WinAnsi characters with the standard fonts until an embedded
  Unicode font path exists (M3, together with overlay fonts).
- Note icons (NoRotate) keep their orientation on pages with an intrinsic /Rotate, as
  ISO 32000 §12.5.6.4 requires (some PDFium-based viewers turn them with the page): the
  icon hangs upright from the /Rect's upper-left corner, so the annotation layer places a
  note's hit target and selection on the drawn icon rather than on its /Rect. The renderer
  does apply the app's own view rotation to them, so a note on a page rotated in the app
  looks turned until export, where the rotation becomes /Rotate and conformant viewers
  show it upright.
- NoZoom is ignored by the renderer: note icons scale with the zoom.

## M3 — Documents as data  (→ 0.3, internal) — **done 2026-09-27**

| Feature | Engine | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fill AcroForms; flatten; detect and warn about XFA | P + L | inline editors for every field type, Tab order across pages, forms panel, pdf-lib flatten pass (PDFium cannot flatten checkboxes) | done (EmbedPDF cannot clear radio groups or empty non-editable dropdowns; option export values not exposed) |
| Page numbers, headers/footers, Bates numbering | L | embedded Inter / JetBrains Mono / Noto Serif subsets, shared placement function, live preview, mirroring, page ranges | done (document-level rules: pages inserted later inherit them; Bates runs derive each document's start from current page counts, so numbers stay unique) |
| Watermark (text/image, opacity, tiling, behind/over) | L | Form XObject reused per page | done (removable /Watermark annotation mode skipped) |
| Metadata view/edit/strip (Info + XMP + attachments + JS) | L | custom keys, BCP-47 language, strip checklist, unreachable objects removed, fresh /ID | done |
| Open encrypted; remove password; set user/owner password and permissions (AES-256) | P + L (Q fallback) | restricted-source badge with permission bits and handler, strength meter, random owner password when omitted | done (qpdf fallback for exotic filters not wired) |
| Compress: lossless pass (object streams, dedupe, unused resources) | L + Q | qpdf built from source, reproducible, CI-verified | done |
| Compress: image downsample + JPEG re-encode with presets | own + P | analysis table, estimate, presets, compare view; skips alpha/CCITT/JBIG2/JPX and at-target images | done (Gray/CMYK re-encoded as RGB; no font subsetting) |
| PDF → images (PNG/JPEG at DPI) | P | plus WebP, tiling, ZIP, clipboard | done |
| Repair broken files with notice | P + Q | "Save repaired copy" through qpdf with verification; diagnostics panel | done (no e2e yet) |
| qpdf built from source in CI behind `PdfPlumber` | Q | ADR-0008 amended: Emscripten 6, zlib and libjpeg-turbo in-tree | done |

Exit: v1.0 success criteria met in Chromium (relabelled 0.3 on 2026-10-01: nothing was published, and 1.0 now has the criteria at the end of this document).
Status: functionality complete and the independent correctness review of M3 resolved (9
findings fixed with regression tests). The M2 cross-viewer gate is now the automated
matrix; v1.0 is tagged once it is green in CI and the owner merges `develop` into `main`.

## M4 — Editing content  (→ 0.4, internal) — **done 2026-09-28**

Engine hosting moved to our own PDFium worker with guarded raw access (ADR-0011); the
viewer's PDFium worker chunk shrank from 1.7 MB to 1 MB.

| Feature | Engine | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Redaction marks: by selection, word, area, search hits, sensitive-data finder (e-mail, phone, IBAN, TCKN, cards, dates) | P | standard `/Redact` annotations through the edit runner; Redactions panel with snippets, review (J/K), honesty text | done |
| Apply redactions: engine pass + path/image removal + scrub + blank-region gate + fill + forensic self-check | P + L + raw | runs on private scratch documents; fails closed with reports; strings scrubbed document-wide (area-only option); attachments removed unless kept and then reported unverified; export re-checks the exact final bytes and blocks the download on any finding | done (no pre-apply tinting of graphics to be removed; overlay text drawn by pdf-lib; JBIG2/CCITT/JPX streams listed as not searched) |
| Text editing, tier 2 (same font, verified) and tier 1 (bundled subset font) | raw | split text object, dry-run read-back, fallback with honesty state; fit: keep, shrink to 75%, overflow; undo = reopen + replay; export renames subset fonts, repairs MCIDs and drops orphaned streams | done (one run = one text object per line; forms are tier 1 with the text moved to page level; Type3, paths, invisible and vertical text refused) |
| Image objects: move, resize, replace, extract | raw | handles, nudge, PNG/JPEG/WebP replace, JPEG pass-through on extract; transforms invertible, remove/replace replay-required | done (in-form images are moved to page level on transform/replace; replace drops the old object's clip and graphics state) |
| Crop with "remove content outside the crop" | model + P | margins, presets, draggable preview, Draw crop area in Read mode; discard runs the redaction pipeline with white fill in the same history entry; shared source pages remove only content hidden everywhere | done (no trim-to-content; content outside the source's own CropBox stays) |
| Page resize with annotation transforms | model + L | scale/fit/canvas, nine anchors, stretch; annotations, widgets, link and outline destinations transformed; verification checks annotations stay on the page | done (NoZoom icons keep their size; border widths and /DA font sizes not scaled) |
| Form field creation | model + L | seven kinds, live widgets, properties popover, tab order, AcroForm materialisation with the existing name policies, flatten, verification | done (`/Tabs` not written; push buttons have no actions; duplicated pages get no fields) |
| Outline editor | model + L | add at current view, rename, delete, move, indent/outdent, drag, open state, dead-link cleanup | done (no generate-from-headings; /XYZ navigation approximate) |

Known behaviours and follow-ups from the workstreams:

- The signature-field reader marks unsigned `/Sig` placeholders as signed after re-open
  (`listFormFields` pairs every `/Sig` field with PDFium's signature list).
- Edited lines become several runs; a later edit works on one run.
- `checkEditability` runs outside the edit queue; a race with a reopen only shows an error.
- Text edits refuse, with a shown reason, text in a form drawn more than once, text whose
  clip an edit would break, and encodings that cannot be read back; tier 2 refuses
  characters with more than one code in the font.
- The redaction content-text check does not decode custom font encodings inside streams
  that are never drawn; page text is covered by the extraction checks.

Exit: the independent correctness review (engine: 1 blocker, 5 major, 5 minor; web: 5
major, 8 minor) is resolved with regression tests (24 findings, 9 fix commits); the
blank-Read-view bug found on the way is fixed; docs and changesets current (relabelled
0.4, unpublished).

## M5 — Recognize and compare  (→ 0.5, internal) — **done 2026-09-28**

Spec: `docs/specs/recognize-and-compare.md`; decisions in ADR-0012 (OCR hosting), ADR-0013
(signatures), ADR-0014 (recipes); spikes in research 07 (OCR) and 08 (signing). Two new
lazy workers beside PDFium: the signature worker (pkijs) and the analysis worker (compare,
Markdown); tesseract's own worker is served from our origin.

| Feature | Engine | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| OCR to searchable PDF: nine language packs on demand, quality Standard / High, replace existing invisible text | tesseract.js + P + L (layer written in the PDFium worker) | scope defaults to pages without text; greyscale rasters in display orientation; glyphless Type0 font, one Form XObject per page, verified in a scratch document; quality Good ≥ 90 / Review 80–90 / Poor < 80; OCR panel with low-confidence rows (J/K, ring on the page); language manager with Keep available offline and local import; `ocr.apply` stores the words, replay never recognises again | done (Chromium-verified: 98% of words found, hit boxes within 2 pt, render pixel-identical, zero external requests, offline after keeping a pack; export verification re-reads every recognised word; a run recognises again the pages that changed under it) |
| Compare two documents: page map, side by side or onion skin, changed areas, changed words, heat map, Changes panel, report PDF | analysis worker (pixelmatch + jsdiff) + P (render, text) | third stage view (3); auto / by index / best match; 100 or 150 dpi; rows in view diffed first; read-only, released when the view is left or a tab closes | done |
| Digital signatures: status on open, Sign… on export | signature worker (pkijs + WebCrypto) + L (incremental update) | Intact / Intact but changed later / Changed after signing / Broken / Cannot check with the fixed honesty line; never "valid"; PAdES-B approval signature as the last export step; existing signatures stripped on rewrite and said so | done (document timestamps checked, no LTV; later revisions read through the xref chain and the signed pages compared visually; DocMDP, encrypted outputs and legacy 3DES/RC2 PKCS#12 refused with the re-export command) |
| PDF → Markdown / text | analysis worker | whole document, page or range; page breaks; running headers and footers dropped or kept; hyphens joined; images in a ZIP; preview with honesty notes; "OCR first" opens the OCR dialog | done (reading order is a heuristic; tables are not detected) |
| Batch: saved recipes over many files | model (`recipe.ts`) + export service | OPFS recipes, import/export, five built-ins, plan review, per-file results with the export summary's notes, ZIP / files / folder delivery, two files at a time; recipes never store a password | done (OCR and Markdown/text steps run; one file at a time while OCR is in the recipe; signed inputs are stripped and the notes say so) |

Known behaviours and follow-ups from the workstreams:

- Engine OCR tests run in Chromium only; the spec asks for Firefox and WebKit too.
- The language manager's switch means "on this device": the pack store cannot tell a pack
  kept offline from one cached on first use.
- Pure OCR helpers are reachable only through the engine's main index; the UI mirrors the
  language-code table for display names.
- Signature classification errs towards "Changed after signing" on nonconforming writers
  (bytes outside any xref, ambiguous duplicate entries); a later revision that restores
  the signed content byte for byte reads "Intact but changed later" with nothing listed.
  Objects of later revisions in encrypted files compare as changed (no decryption).
- The visual comparison of signed revisions renders every page once per signature at
  50 dpi; bounded and cancellable, redundant for many-signature files.
- Compare has no "the file as opened" side (spec §2.1); Esc in the Compare view first
  clears a leftover page selection.
- A resized page's OCR words are verified by text only at export (the visible-box origin is
  not in the model); OCR words on a source redacted afterwards are covered by the
  redaction self-check instead.

Exit: two independent correctness reviews (engine: 1 blocker, 3 major, 6 minor; web: 1
blocker, 4 major, 7 minor) and a second pass on the blocker fixes (1 blocker, 1 major, 3
minor, plus one bypass found while fixing) resolved in six fix commits with regression
tests and five new attack fixtures; docs and changesets current (relabelled 0.5,
unpublished; the first public release follows M7).

## M6 — Experience  (→ 1.0.0-beta.0 together with M7) — **done 2026-10-01**

Owner review after M5 (`DISCUSSION.md` item 23): the features are right, the experience is
not. Too much is visible at once, nobody can find Merge, and the pen interrupts writing.
Spec: `docs/specs/experience-redesign.md`; evidence: `docs/design/experience-audit-2026-10.md`
(with an "After M6" section); decisions in ADR-0018 (variable-width ink) and research 09
(the ink appearance spike); design rules in `docs/DESIGN.md` §2–§4 (amendments A1–A6) and
`docs/specs/viewer-annotations.md` (A7).

| Feature | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Home view | open files as cards, multi-select, Combine N files, drag a card onto another to merge; the empty state is the same view with honest text | done (from an empty app, drop two files, "Combine 2 files", "Merge": one document with every page in Read in 3 counted actions, e2e; a card dropped on another opens the merge dialog as [target, dragged]; nothing merges without the dialog) |
| Navigator with four labelled tabs | Pages (with Bookmarks), Find, Review (comments, redaction marks, form fields in one list), Files; content first, settings folded; inspector closed by default, metadata in a Document info sheet | done (four tabs with counts in their names, e.g. "Pages, 6 items"; Compare's Changes tab only in Compare, last; the inspector closed on first run and remembered once opened, e2e; the comment author asked once, inline) |
| Task-grouped toolbar | about six labelled groups (Read, Mark up, Draw, Fill & sign, Pages, Redact); a group shows its 3–6 tools; options live with the armed tool; Document menu with sections and Merge, Split, Compare, Rotate | done (six groups; the capsule morphs in place in one 160 ms movement, none under reduced motion; options in a tier attached to the bar; each shortcut arms its tool and shows its group, e2e; Document menu in five sections with no disabled twins) |
| Natural pen | creating a stroke never selects it; a compact pen bar with four presets that persist; strokes in a burst become one Ink annotation (one comment row, one undo step); lasso to recolour, resize, move or delete; coalesced pointer events, live smoothed preview, width from pressure or speed, fingers scroll when a pen is present | done (no bar and no selection at any time while writing, e2e with a MutationObserver from the first stroke; the preview stays until the committed stroke is painted; presets survive a reload; bursts of N = 1.5 s and D = 36 pt, at most 64 paths: three strokes are one Ink, one Review row "Pen · 3 strokes", one undo; the lasso takes every path it touches and splits edited paths into a new Ink in the same history entry; a pen stroke with force 0.2 → 1.0 is thinner at its start, written into our appearance with a constant `/BS /W` after S1 passed, both matrix rows ok in PDFium and pdf.js; after a pen, a finger drag scrolls and draws nothing) |
| Merge discoverability and wording | Home actions, Document menu, Arrange shows every open document, palette synonyms in English and Turkish, "Ink" becomes "Pen", the two "Sign" features get distinct names | done (Merge from Home, the Document menu, the tab menus and the palette; "draw", "kalem", "ciz", "birlestir" and "sertifika" list the right command first, e2e; Pen, Signature image, Sign with certificate…) |
| Visual refresh | surface ladder with measured contrast, livelier glass with one elevation shadow for floating chrome, capsule toolbar with a solid accent for the active tool, pen presets as ink dots, rise-in motion honouring reduced motion | done (canvas → panel 1.05:1 → 1.14:1; glass over the canvas 1.03:1 → 1.27:1; the armed tool 1.24:1 → 3.43:1 against the bar over a white page, 5.28:1 over the canvas; text on glass stays AA over every measured backdrop, minimum 4.51:1; `tokens.test.ts` asserts each ratio; measurements in `docs/design/audit-2026-10/V1-RESULTS.md`) |

Known behaviours and follow-ups from the workstreams:

- Home has no per-card ⋯ menu (Combine with…, Document info…), no reordering of cards by
  drag and no recent files; the card's size is the file's size as opened. The Files tab
  shares Home's selection with Combine and Show Home (review fix).
- Compare still has no "the file as opened" side (as in M5).
- Bursts' N (1.5 s), D (36 pt horizontally) and the line rule (bands overlapping by 30 %
  or a gap under 0.6 of the burst's median stroke height) are reasoned defaults; they are
  still to be tried on a real tablet with the owner. Both numbers are overridable in the
  stored pen settings, with no UI. Inside an open burst, undo removes one stroke.
- Variable width lives in our appearance stream; `/InkList` keeps the centre lines and
  `/BS /W` the nominal width, so a viewer that redraws ink itself (an editor rebuilding
  the appearance) shows one width. The pen's options tier says so in one honesty line,
  and the tier stays hidden until a pen has reported pressure in the session.
- A page resize scales the stored ink widths by the geometric mean of the scale (review
  fix); an ink that loses its widths keeps an empty `/PdfEditorInkWidths` key, read as
  "no widths".
- Clicking the armed preset while its tooltip is showing does not open the editor
  (keyboard and quick clicks do); a pre-existing tooltip interaction, listed for P2's
  follow-up.
- The bytes of a plain `save()` keep the replaced ink appearance streams until export,
  which rewrites the file.
- The §11 visual baselines (`visual.spec.ts`) are not in the suite, and the no-blink
  check is a component test (`annotations/writing.test.tsx`), not the frame-sampling e2e
  the spec describes.

Exit: the independent review on the live build (no blocker; 3 major correctness findings
on lasso and selection width changes and self-selecting redaction marks, 4 minor, and five
experience gaps) and the accessibility pass (F6 regions, roving tabindex everywhere, joined
announcements, zero axe violations on every state) are resolved in one fix commit with
regression tests; the merge, pen, navigator and contrast criteria pass as recorded above;
`docs/DESIGN.md` and the screenshots are current. **Done 2026-10-01**, pending the owner's
tablet try-out of the burst defaults.

## M7 — Presentation and public beta  (→ 1.0.0-beta.0) — **built 2026-10-01, release pending the owner's steps**

Spec: `docs/specs/presentation.md`; decisions: ADR-0015 (name: Recto), ADR-0016 (addresses
and migration), ADR-0017 (versioning and releases).

| Item | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Name and addresses | display name Recto, descriptor "Recto PDF"; repository `recto`, app at `erendenizk.github.io/recto/` (GitHub Pages only for now, owner decision 2026-10-01), redirect pages and a kill-switch worker at `/pdf-editor/` in the portfolio repository; storage names unchanged; a custom domain later follows ADR-0016 | done in the repository (the redirect folder and kill-switch worker in `tools/portfolio-redirect/` with an end-to-end hand-over test; the rename pass with a unit test that the storage names of ADR-0015 §3 are unchanged). Owner steps: create `ErenDenizK.github.io` with the folder, rename the repository, then remove the temporary lychee exclusions; trademark check |
| README and media | thesis, hero, four GIFs (Arrange, Redact, OCR, Compare), feature table, "Check it yourself", worker diagram, limits; media produced by Playwright screencasts and ffmpeg in a deploy job, served from the site, zipped onto releases; fictional demo documents | done (fictional demo documents in `test/fixtures/demo/` with a `--check` mode; the media tool in `tools/media/` with nine scenes, the social image, budgets, a request log and the spike in research 10; the README rewritten with evidence links; the copy check and lychee in CI's `docs` job; the deploy workflow's `media` job) |
| About page and metadata | `/about/` as a second entry with no app bundle; "About this app" in the menu; repository description, topics, social preview | done in the repository (`/about/` with its budget test; "About this app" in the Document menu and the palette; Open Graph tags). Owner steps: repository description, topics and the social preview upload (spec §4) |
| Release mechanics | Changesets pre-release mode, `v1.0.0-beta.0` tag, GitHub pre-release with notes and a dist zip with SHA-256 | prepared (the in-app About dialog with version, commit, build date and "Public beta"; `release.yml` with the notes template `.github/release-notes.md`; pre mode entered and the packages versioned `1.0.0-beta.0` on `develop`). Remaining: the release pull request `develop` → `main`, whose merge tags `v1.0.0-beta.0` and publishes the pre-release |

Exit: the live site answers at the new address with the old one redirecting; README
renders with every image under budget; the About page passes its size budget; the
`v1.0.0-beta.0` release exists with notes.

## Exit criteria for 1.0 (ADR-0017)

- Every v1.0 success criterion in `VISION.md` passes as an automated test on Chromium,
  Firefox and WebKit.
- Final name and domain in place; load time and the zero-external-requests budget measured
  in CI.
- Stored formats (recipes, settings, caches) versioned with migration tests.
- At least four weeks and two betas without an open blocker or major bug; the known-issues
  list fixed or documented.
- Accessibility pass; complete English and Turkish; documentation current; an independent
  review of the beta.

## M8 — Craft  (→ 1.0.0-beta.1 and beta.2, tagged only when the owner says so) — **built 2026-10-04; drop 1 and drop 2 built, tagging waits for the owner**

Owner review of the beta (`docs/DISCUSSION.md` #28, 2026-10-03): every feature exists and
works, but the experience is raw. Text editing feels like a patch and hides under "Pages";
the pen is slightly laggy and sticky with a mouse; Draw and Mark up both have a highlighter;
the lasso ignores arrows; colours look unclean; Home · Read · Arrange is the wrong top-level
model; glass should go wider but never opaque. Spec: `docs/specs/craft.md` (what each work
package delivered is in its §15); decisions: ADR-0019 (modes), ADR-0020 (paragraph editing
tiers), ADR-0021 (one Highlighter, lasso for every kind, one palette); research 11
(paragraph editing in PDF), 12 (low-latency ink), 13 (glass and modes), 14 (the glass spike);
audits summarised in the spec's §1.2; design rules in `docs/DESIGN.md` §2–§5 (amendments
A8–A14, A15 as a trial) and §9. Approved by the owner on 2026-10-03 with Tier C dropped; the
drops below are planning units and the owner decides when a drop is tagged as a beta.

Latency figures come from `apps/web/e2e/ink-latency.spec.ts` on a shared 4-core container
in headless Chromium, under a load average of 9–15 unless stated, so they are upper bounds;
the baseline and every step are in `docs/qa/ink-latency-baseline.md`.

| Feature | Engine | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Home as a view; documents in Read (locked) ⇄ Edit; Arrange as a view; keys 0–4; Edit bar with five groups (Select · Write · Text · Fill & sign · Redact) | own | per-document mode flag; the bar collapses to one Edit button in Read; "Switch to Edit to fill" on fields; a text selection bar and a page context menu; Recents on Home with file handles where the browser keeps them (P2, moved in from M9) | done (drop 1; Recents drop 2): a file opens in Read with the lock and a one-button bar; in Read a drag neither selects nor moves, Delete does nothing, a tool key switches to Edit and arms the tool with "Edit mode. …" and creates nothing, a field click shows the notice and its Edit button fills; `0` then a tab click lands in the document's last mode (e2e `modes.spec.ts`); the bar walks five groups and the page menu by keyboard (e2e `tools.spec.ts`, `a11y.spec.ts`); a closed file is remembered across a reload, opened again and cleared (e2e `home.spec.ts`). *Amended 2026-10-04 (M8 review):* Home shows only the Files rail and "N files" in the status bar; Recents are cards with a page glyph, no thumbnails; Combine keeps its sources open and creates "Combined – A + B" with an Undo toast (Arrange's "Merge all open documents" still replaces its inputs); notes save on Esc and click-away, and only an empty new note is dropped; tabs grow to 220 px; Appearance shows check states; in Read the page context menu has one row, "Switch to Edit to change pages", instead of Rotate, Delete and Crop; opening the Text group arms Edit text; tiers open only when the armed tool is pressed again; the bar and tiers fade to 20 % during a stroke and for 1 s after; P arms the last writing pen and H the Highlighter; Esc goes to Select, then to the group row; Read's selection bar has "Edit text" |
| Edit-mode interaction policy: only the armed tool creates; double-click on page text opens the paragraph editor (mouse or pen-as-pointer only); idle hover outline with a one-time hint; the pen never hit-tests text; one hit order across layers | own | ADR-0019 §5–§6; `viewer/hit-order.ts` | done (drop 1): a double-click opens the paragraph editor in Edit and selects a word in Read; a pen stroke over text writes ink and never opens the editor, Select stays armed (e2e `modes.spec.ts`); the outline after 400 ms, never from touch or within 300 ms of a pen lift; eraser end, barrel lasso and Space pan (`viewer/edit-policy.test.tsx`). *Amended 2026-10-04 (M8 review):* Select keeps the double-click, and a first plain click on page text shows the "Double-click to edit text" hint |
| Pen smoothness: measurement harness, constant-width mouse, one smoothed stroke model for preview and commit, own prediction, round joins, bake-once stable layer, dot cursor, no debounce on edit repaints | own | targets: ≤ 1 frame pointer-to-preview, committed stroke visible ≤ 50 ms after pen-up with no change of shape, no long task in a 64-path burst | done (drop 1): the committed outline lies within 0.5 device px of the last preview frame for a recorded mouse stroke (`apps/web/src/annotations/pen/ink-input.test.ts`); preview draw p95 0.3–1.0 ms, flat to 5,000 points; the release redraw of a 5,000-sample stroke 19 → 2–11 ms; mouse committed visible p50 231 → 77–140 ms before the dry layer (next row). Not met on this machine: event-to-draw p95 11–18 ms against ≤ 4 ms (the draw waits for the next frame) |
| Dry ink layer with deferred page re-render; cheaper bursts (cached outlines, fewer worker round trips); clip repaints; `pointerrawupdate` and the Windows Ink API where the harness shows presentation latency | own + P | research 12 §5–§7 | done (drop 2) except `pointerrawupdate` and the Ink API (P14, not started: the harness did not show presentation latency as the bottleneck): committed stroke visible p95 26–34 ms for mouse strokes and 21–39 ms in a 64-stroke pen burst (target ≤ 50 ms; baseline 520–640 ms and 1.8–3.9 s); long entries over 50 ms in the burst 15–51 → 4–5 (target none); `listAnnotations` per 12-stroke burst 34 → 1; an append at 64 paths 25–32 → 6–7 ms; the stroke's box re-renders in 0.3 ms instead of 16.5–19 ms for the page; page bitmap settled p95 162–163 ms (burst) and 120–177 ms (mouse) |
| One Highlighter (constant width, Multiply, snaps to text as a Highlight annotation, Alt for free ink); lasso for every annotation kind with mixed selection and group edits; partial eraser | P + own | ADR-0021; group resize and rotate (P12) and hold to straighten (P13) | done (drop 1; partial eraser drop 2): H, then a stroke along a line gives one Highlight and "Highlighted 1 line on page 1", a stroke on paper a `#FFEA00` Multiply ink (e2e `pen.spec.ts`, `a11y.spec.ts`; the matrix row "Ink, Multiply (free highlighter)" ok in PDFium and pdf.js); a stroke, an arrow and a note recoloured, moved or deleted in one history entry (`lasso/edits.test.ts`); a corner handle grows two lassoed strokes about the opposite corner; a Partial erase through a stroke leaves two pieces and one undo restores; a pause while drawing commits a two-point line (e2e `pen.spec.ts`) |
| One palette for presets and swatches (eight inks in two lightness bands, four Multiply highlighter tints), contrast asserted; accent unchanged, vividness through content colour and state alphas | own | ADR-0021 §3–§4 | done (drop 1) except two parts: one module (`annotations/palette.ts`) with every ratio asserted (`palette.test.ts`); presets and tool styles migrate `v1` → `v2`; a default colour never shows as "custom". Tag dots at full chroma and the raised accent alphas were not done |
| Text editing speed-ups: analysis cached per page, pure maths per keystroke, dry run on pause and commit, caret at the click, free space bounded by the column, no render-priority slot held | raw | audit items 1, 2, 10, 12, 13 | done (drop 1): engine calls while typing five keys 5 → 0, then one dry run after a 300 ms pause; per-keystroke arithmetic about 0.002 ms; the analysis about 66 ms once per run and revision (`text-edit/TextEditor.test.tsx`, `packages/engine/src/text-edit/analysis.test.ts`) |
| Paragraph editor (Tier B): structure tree first, geometry fallback, style spans, rewrap from the edit point, original font with per-glyph bundled substitutes and one honesty line, overflow policy (grow into the gap, tighten the rewritten lines within floors, then offer "Tighten to fit" for the whole paragraph, refuse text that would cross the page edge, and never commit an overlap unasked), glyph-path canvas overlay with a deferred exact preview, corpus with golden read-backs | raw + own | ADR-0020; Tier C (same-page push-down) and Tier D (cross-page reflow) declined by the owner; Noto Sans Regular bundled | done (drop 2): corpus goldens on six fixtures (`packages/engine/src/text-edit/corpus-goldens.test.ts`, 13 tests): exact read-back, untouched glyphs within 0.01 pt, zero pixels changed outside the paragraph, keystroke layout median 0.0–0.4 ms (budget 4 ms); replay byte-identical; e2e: type into a paragraph, preview, one history entry, export and re-open, and ‘ğ’ named as Noto Sans (`paragraph-edit.spec.ts`, `text-edit.spec.ts`). The corpus has no real Word or LibreOffice export. *Amended 2026-10-04 (M8 review):* leaving with an overlap keeps the editor open with "Tighten to fit" (when it fits), "Let it overlap" and "Keep editing"; per-character styles are kept through multi-change sessions (fails closed); multi-line highlights and links follow their words per quad; hard line breaks are kept and the measure is bounded by an enclosing box (`address-boxes.pdf` added to the corpus); the header sits in the page margin, else above the bar, else below the paragraph, and Join with next and Split here are hidden; the plate is a dry-run render of the paragraph's area emptied; the hover outline shows the paragraph box |
| Glass spike S2 and the "Glass panels" setting: stage full-bleed under the chrome, three glass tiers, docked tier composites to `--surface-1` over the canvas, in-app Reduce transparency; fps, GPU memory and contrast measured | own | DESIGN §2 changes only if S2 passes and the owner likes the live build | built behind the setting, default off (drop 1); *amended 2026-10-04 (M8 review):* the 80 px gate is removed, so with Glass panels on all four docked surfaces blur in every view (cost in `docs/research/14-glass-spike.md` §4.2), and the floating bar's tier is unchanged because no lighter value passed the contrast tests (§4.3 there); S2 pending: contrast final for the three tiers over white, the canvas, `#808080` and black (`styles/tokens.test.ts`); frame rate, GPU memory and legibility wait for the owner's machine (`docs/research/14-glass-spike.md`); a headless CPU trend shows the blur costing two to four times the median frame |

Accessibility (craft §9): one keyboard target per paragraph with Edit text armed, lasso
handles with 24 px hit areas, the Highlighter's line count announced, mode announcements only
on change; axe passes on every new state in English and Turkish, with Glass panels on and
with Reduce transparency (e2e `a11y.spec.ts`). Tests on the M8 tree before the review fixes (`45e7a35`): the full
Chromium end-to-end suite passed 129 with 9 skipped by their own gates, the engine unit suite
809 and the web unit suite 1,388; CI runs Firefox and WebKit as well.

Known behaviours and follow-ups from the workstreams:

- Latency: no quiet-machine or CI baseline yet; event-to-draw p95 (11–18 ms) and 4–5 long
  entries per 64-stroke burst miss their targets on the loaded container; a 5,000-sample
  stroke shows its committed shape after 165–229 ms (the release task's smoothing); at
  tiled zoom, tiles re-render on every revision instead of waiting with the dry layer.
- Paragraph editor: closing a document still commits a draft that has no overlap (a draft
  that overlaps is kept or discarded with an announcement, never committed); a paragraph
  edit that uses two substitute fonts is listed under the first in the export summary; the
  plate under rewritten lines covers the paragraph's original box only, so a line that
  grows below it sits on white until the preview settles; "Join with next" and "Split
  here" are hidden, not built; the IME candidate window opens at the hidden mirror, not at
  the drawn caret; an arrow typed into a serif paragraph is refused although Inter has it; a
  full (non-subset) embedded font can get a false honesty line; a shortening edit after a
  hyphenated line end in a TeX-justified paragraph can leave the previous line ragged;
  ligatures are written as two glyphs; rotated pages are covered by one e2e test only.
- Policy: the first-click hint sits below the clicked line and can cover the start of the
  next line until the next press; in Select a plain press on a markup over a form field reaches the field (the hit
  order decides double-click and hover only); annotations are not dimmed under Edit text;
  a pen's very first press, before any hover, acts as a pointer once; with the Highlighter
  armed, a pen in Select draws with the first pen; the Forms panel's Add field and Clear
  buttons still show in Read, doing nothing; a note click in Read opens no read-only popover;
  the one-line editor's header can sit under the title bar near the top of the free
  rectangle.
- Lasso and eraser: stamps keep their orientation under rotation (needs an appearance
  `/Matrix`); line and shape stroke widths do not scale with a resize; no erase filter for
  highlighter strokes (they erase whole) and no live cut preview while erasing.
- Palette: tag dots and accent alphas unchanged (above); the redaction mark outline
  (`#E53935`) and the signature ink (`#1A237E`) sit outside the palette, and a redaction
  mark's black fill shows as "custom".
- Glass: with the gate removed, Arrange's p95 frame time rises with Glass panels on (17–33
  ms to 67–100 ms in the headless trend, median unchanged); gating the blur to Read is the
  first lever if S2 fails narrowly (research 14 §4.2).
- Home: on the empty app, with no file open, the rail still shows its four tabs with the
  panel collapsed (the M6 A1 decision, asserted by `home.spec.ts`); with files open only
  Files shows.
- `4` still announces when pressed in Compare; Compare's second file is not recorded in
  Recents; `text-edit/TextEditor.test.tsx`'s timing test fails under heavy load and passes
  alone.

Exit: met in the repository: the corpus passes its golden read-backs; the interaction-policy
table of craft §3.5 is covered by e2e (`modes.spec.ts`, `tools.spec.ts`, `a11y.spec.ts`)
and component tests; contrast tests pass for the palette and the three glass tiers; the
committed-stroke and preview targets are met on the container, the event-to-draw and
long-task targets are not. Waiting for the owner: the latency check on their laptop and the
pen try-out with a mouse and a tablet; the S2 glass measurements and an opinion on Glass
panels. The independent review ran on 2026-10-04 (`docs/DISCUSSION.md` #31): its findings
are fixed with regression tests, except the floating glass tier (contrast), and the open
ones are listed above. Drop 1 and drop 2 built; tagging waits for the owner.

## M9 — Redesign  (→ 1.0.0-beta.N, tagged only when the owner says so) — planned 2026-10-04, awaiting the owner's approval

Owner brief (2026-10-04): rethink the whole interface from scratch in a language of glass, a
lime aurora light and motion; simple, native and natural like Apple Preview and Notability; few,
predictable steps; phone and desktop alike; smart, rich and expensive; plan the brand and the
About page but do not build them yet; no beta tag until the owner says "beta v1". Spec:
`docs/specs/redesign.md` (§6 resolves every issue the component authors raised, §14 holds the
six owner questions). Decisions: ADR-0022 to ADR-0028 (the Recto Glass language: layers, colour,
materials, light, motion, type and icons, accessibility gates) and ADR-0029 to ADR-0032 (viewing
and Markup with Lock, the `canChange` guard, the size-class shell, saving and restore), all
proposed. Inputs: research 15–22; the visual baseline, inventory and current flows under
`docs/design/redesign-2026-10/`; proposals A, B and C and three judges; the chosen model
(`flows.md`), the language (`language.md`) and nine component specs (`components/`); the brand
plan `docs/brand/README.md`. Tablets and phones (formerly M10) are part of this milestone. Each
drop is a working app; the owner decides whether and when any of them becomes "beta v1"
(spec §14 question 6 recommends after D3).

Waiting for the owner (spec §14): approval of the plan; the default lock; kept documents; a taste
check on the concept prototype; Gate 0; the machine checks (glass frames, edge-leak probe, Safari
`var()`, aurora banding and drift, a phone and tablet run); whether "beta v1" waits for the
redesign.

Exit: spec §10.5.

## M10 — Ecosystem  (→ 2.0)

Numbered M9 until 2026-10-04.

- Light theme on the same tokens (moved from M6 on 2026-10-01; moved again into M9, drop D3,
  on 2026-10-04).
- Plugin API for tools.
- Optional Tauri desktop shell with file associations.
- Browser extension "open with".
- Annotation set export/import as files.

## Tablet and phone (formerly M10)

Moved into M9 (drops D0 and D2) on 2026-10-04, because the brief asks for phone and desktop together and the redesign's size-class shell (ADR-0031) is the tablet and phone layout.

## Explicitly deferred or declined

- Office ↔ PDF conversion (fidelity), PDF/A claims (no validator), cloud collaboration,
  any hosted or metered service, any telemetry.
