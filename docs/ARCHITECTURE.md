# Architecture

**Status:** proposed (2026-09-26). Decisions referenced here are recorded as ADRs in
`docs/adr/`; anything marked *open* is still under discussion in `docs/DISCUSSION.md`.

## 1. Constraints that shape everything

| Constraint | Consequence |
|---|---|
| No backend; static hosting on GitHub Pages | All PDF processing in the browser (JS + WebAssembly). No custom HTTP headers, so no COOP/COEP, so **no SharedArrayBuffer / WASM threads** by default. |
| Permissive license (proposed Apache-2.0, ADR-0001) | MuPDF.js, Ghostscript WASM and scribe.js (all AGPL) are excluded. Allowed engines: pdf.js, PDFium, pdf-lib, qpdf, tesseract.js. |
| Large files (hundreds of MB, thousands of pages) | Engines run in Web Workers; single-threaded WASM per worker; one worker per document; ~2 GiB heap ceiling per worker; OPFS for scratch; streaming saves. |
| Multi-document editing with cheap undo | A **virtual document model** that references source pages and only materializes on export. |
| Correctness | Document-level structures (outlines, links, page labels, AcroForm, metadata) are reconciled explicitly by our own code, never left to a library's `copyPages`. |

## 2. Engine layering (ADR-0002)

```

Roles:

- **PDFium (`@embedpdf/pdfium` + `@embedpdf/engines`, MIT, v2 line)** is the single
  rendering engine and the content-level editor: page bitmaps and thumbnails, glyph
  geometry for selection and search, annotation CRUD with generated appearance streams,
  form field values and widget appearance regeneration, true redaction, flatten, save.
  Since M4 (ADR-0011) it runs in the app's own module worker
  (`@pdf-editor/engine/pdfium.worker` behind `createPdfiumProxy`): one hosted engine
  (`init` + `PdfiumNative` + `PdfEngine`) serves the adapter and, through a guarded raw
  access with a per-source lock (`pdfium/host/`), the content editors (`text-edit/`,
  `image-objects/`, `redaction/`). ~1 MB gzip worker chunk, loaded on first document
  open and cached by the service worker.
- **`@cantoo/pdf-lib` (MIT)** is the *assembler*: it turns a virtual document into bytes.
  It copies pages between documents, applies rotation, prepends/appends overlay content
  (page numbers, headers, watermarks), rebuilds `/Outlines`, `/PageLabels`, `/AcroForm`,
  `/Info` and XMP, and encrypts (AES-256). Pure JS, ~250 KB gzip.
- **qpdf (WASM, Apache-2.0)** is the *plumber*: structural repair, object-stream
  generation, linearization, and a second, independent decrypt/encrypt path. ~0.45 MB
  gzip, loaded only when needed. We build the WASM ourselves in CI from qpdf 12.x rather
  than depending on a single-maintainer npm wrapper (*open*).
- **tesseract.js (Apache-2.0)** for OCR (M5, ADR-0012): its worker and LSTM cores are served
  from our origin under `ocr/tesseract-<version>/`, the language packs gzipped under
  `ocr/lang/` and pinned by hash; the recognizer adapter (`ocr/recognizer.ts`) runs on the
  main thread and posts greyscale rasters from the PDFium worker. The invisible text layer
  is written by pdf-lib inside the PDFium worker (`PdfOcrLayer`), one Form XObject per page
  with Tesseract's glyphless font, verified in a scratch document and recorded as an
  `ocr.apply` edit that stores the words, so replay never recognises again.
- **PKI.js (BSD-3-Clause)** in the signature worker (`worker/signature.worker.ts`, ADR-0013):
  CMS validation over WebCrypto with revision classification (Intact, Intact but changed
  later, Changed after signing, Broken, Cannot check) and PAdES-B approval signing with a
  local PKCS#12 as the last export step. Identity and trust are never claimed.
- **Analysis worker** (`worker/analysis.worker.ts`, pure JS): document comparison (page
  alignment, pixelmatch visual diff, jsdiff word diff, the report PDF through pdf-lib) and
  the layout-to-Markdown / text converter. Started on first use, ended after two idle
  minutes.
- **pdf.js is not in the default build.** It remains the documented fallback renderer
  if PDFium fidelity or performance disappoints on a class of files, and its source is our
  reference for text-layer and highlight QuadPoint construction. (*open*: see
  `DISCUSSION.md` item 2.)

Every engine sits behind a TypeScript interface owned by us (`PdfRenderer`,
`PdfEditor`, `PdfAssembler`, `PdfPlumber`) so an engine can be swapped without touching
the UI. Nothing is loaded from a CDN; all WASM and font/CMap assets ship with the app.

## 3. Virtual document model

```ts
interface Workspace {
  sources: Record<SourceId, SourceDocument>;   // opened files, immutable bytes
  documents: Record<DocId, VirtualDocument>;   // what the user sees in tabs
  history: HistoryStack;                        // immutable snapshots, structural sharing
}

interface SourceDocument {
  id: SourceId; name: string; bytes: ArrayBuffer /* transferred to its worker */;
  pageCount: number; encrypted: boolean; repaired: boolean; hasXfa: boolean;
  edits: EngineEditLog;   // annotation/form/redaction edits applied inside PDFium
}

interface VirtualDocument {
  id: DocId; title: string;
  pages: VirtualPage[];
  outline: OutlineNode[];          // reconciled from sources, user-editable
  labels: PageLabelRange[];        // preserved from sources
  metadata: DocumentMetadata;      // Info + XMP policy
  security?: SecurityPolicy;       // passwords + permission bits
}

interface VirtualPage {
  id: PageId;
  ref: { source: SourceId; index: number } | { blank: { width: number; height: number } }
     | { image: BlobId };
  rotation: 0 | 90 | 180 | 270;    // delta on top of the source /Rotate
  cropBox?: Rect;
  resize?: PageResize;             // new page size, applied after the crop (see below)
  overlays: OverlayOp[];           // page numbers, watermark, header/footer (declarative)
}

interface PageResize {             // unrotated user space, like cropBox
  width: number; height: number;   // the new page box, points
  mode: 'scale' | 'fit' | 'canvas'; // cover (or `stretch`), fit with margins, keep 100%
  anchor: Anchor;                  // nine positions; where the content sits
  stretch?: boolean;               // scale only: per-axis scale, fills exactly
}
```

- Structural operations (reorder, delete, rotate, duplicate, move across documents,
  split, merge) are array edits on `VirtualDocument.pages`. They are O(1) to O(n) on
  small arrays and instantly undoable.
- Content operations (annotate, fill, redact, edit text, move or replace images) are
  applied to the source's PDFium document inside the worker and recorded per source as
  `EngineEdit`s. Annotation and form edits and image transforms carry exact inverses; text
  edits, image removal or replacement and applied redactions are non-invertible and marked
  "replay required": undo reopens the source's original bytes and replays the remaining
  edit list (byte-identical by construction), redo re-applies the recorded edit. Applied
  redactions and crop-with-discard replace the source's bytes with a verified result under
  the same page ids.
- **Undo/redo** is a pointer into a persistent history of workspace snapshots (Immer-style
  structural sharing) plus command replay for engine-side edits. Drag and color changes
  coalesce (pdf.js `CommandManager` model). History is persisted to IndexedDB/OPFS with
  the source bytes so a crashed tab can be recovered.
- Rendering a virtual page = render the source page (cached `ImageBitmap` keyed by
  source, index, rotation, scale) + overlay canvas.
- **Resize** maps the content box (what the crop leaves visible) into the new page box by
  x' = a·x + e, y' = d·y + f (document-model `resize.ts`, shared by every consumer). It is
  stored unrotated so a later rotation turns the resized page as a whole; the dialog's
  displayed size and anchor are converted per page. On screen the source bitmap is placed
  at the content placement and the viewer's page frame folds the matrix in, so text,
  links, annotations, forms and search follow; at export the assembler keeps the copied
  page and wraps its content in `q <matrix> cm … Q`, transforming page boxes, annotation
  and widget geometry and destinations (`pdflib/page-resize.ts`). The verification pass
  checks the new page sizes and that annotations of pages whose content fits stay inside.

## 4. Export pipeline

1. For each source that has engine edits: PDFium `saveAsCopy` in its worker → edited
   bytes (annotations, form values, redactions applied; redaction forces full rewrite).
2. Assembly worker (pdf-lib): create the output document; for each `VirtualPage` copy the
   page from the (edited) source with a per-source copier that de-duplicates shared
   resources; set `/Rotate`; apply crop; draw overlays behind or over content inside
   balanced `q … Q`.
3. **Document-level reconciliation** (our code, the part competitors skip):
   - outlines: walk each source outline, keep nodes whose target page survived, remap
     destinations (explicit and named), optionally wrap each source under a parent node;
   - links: rewrite `/Dest` and GoTo actions, drop links to removed pages;
   - AcroForm: merge `/DR` fonts, wrap each source's fields under a namespaced parent (or
     rename collisions), regenerate appearances, set `/NeedAppearances false`;
   - page labels: rebuild `/PageLabels` from per-page labels;
   - tagged PDF: if the structure tree cannot be preserved intact, remove
     `/StructTreeRoot` and `/MarkInfo` and tell the user;
   - metadata: apply the chosen policy, regenerate `/ID`.
4. Optional: encrypt (pdf-lib AES-256) or hand to qpdf for linearize / compatibility mode
   (no object streams, PDF 1.4).
5. **Verification pass**: re-open the output in a fresh PDFium worker, check page count,
   extract text under redaction boxes (must be empty), compare page sizes; applied
   redactions re-run their forensic self-check on the exact final bytes. Only then offer
   the download.
6. Optional **signing** (ADR-0013): after verification, the signature worker appends one
   PAdES-B approval signature as an incremental update; the signed bytes are re-opened in
   PDFium once more before delivery. Because every export is a rewrite, signatures present
   in the sources are stripped, and the dialog says so.
7. Delivery: File System Access API stream (Chromium) → OPFS + `<a download>`
   (Firefox/Safari).

Incremental updates (append-only saves) are used only when the user annotated or filled a
single source and the source is signed or the user asks to preserve history. Never after
redaction, merge or repair.

## 5. File input

Three-tier open path: `showOpenFilePicker` → `<input type=file multiple>` fallback;
drag and drop resolves `DataTransferItem.getAsFileSystemHandle()` →
`webkitGetAsEntry()` (recursive folder walk) → `getAsFile()`. Bytes are transferred
(not copied) to the document's worker. Encrypted files prompt for a password in the UI and
are opened by PDFium; "remove password" and "set password" go through pdf-lib (fallback
qpdf). Files that PDFium had to repair on open are flagged and the user is offered a
repaired copy rather than an incremental save onto a broken xref.

## 6. Frontend (ADR-0003)

- **Vite 8 + TypeScript 7 (strict) + React 19 with the React Compiler.**
- State: **Zustand** stores (workspace, viewer, selection, tool mode); history implemented
  as our own snapshot stack, not a generic middleware.
- Tool/mode state machine: a small explicit state machine (XState Store or hand-rolled)
  for `idle → selecting → dragging → committing`, so drag-and-drop, keyboard moves and
  touch share one model.
- Virtualization: **TanStack Virtual** for the light table grid and thumbnail rail.
- Drag and drop: **Atlassian pragmatic-drag-and-drop** (native HTML5 DnD, cross-document
  and OS file drops share primitives) with our own keyboard fallback and live-region
  announcements.
- Worker RPC: **Comlink** behind our interfaces.
- Styling: **design tokens as CSS custom properties + CSS Modules**; no component
  framework. Headless accessibility primitives for menus, dialogs, tooltips (*open*:
  Radix Primitives vs Base UI).
- Routing: hash-based or none; the app is a single workspace.
- i18n: **Paraglide JS** (compiled, typed messages); English first, Turkish second.

## 7. Deployment and offline

- **Address** (ADR-0016): GitHub Pages only for now. The app is the project site of the
  repository `recto` at `https://erendenizk.github.io/recto/`, with the about page beside it
  at `/recto/about/` (a second Vite entry that loads no app code). The old address
  `/pdf-editor/` is a redirect folder with a kill-switch service worker in the portfolio
  repository `ErenDenizK.github.io` (source: `tools/portfolio-redirect/`). A custom domain
  later sets the repository variable `CUSTOM_DOMAIN`, which builds for `/`.
- Vite `base` comes from `VITE_BASE_PATH` (`/<repository>/` in CI, `/` with a custom
  domain); the manifest `id`, `scope` and `start_url`, the service worker scope, the
  navigation fallback, worker URLs and WASM URLs all derive from it.
- **GitHub Actions**:
  - `ci.yml` on every push and pull request: format, lint, typecheck, unit and browser-mode
    tests, the annotation cross-viewer matrix, the OCR lock check and the build (in the
    Playwright container), then end-to-end tests on Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, and a
    `docs` job on a plain runner: the copy check (`tools/copy-check`, the banned words of
    the presentation spec §1.3) and lychee (`lychee.toml`) over the README, `docs/`,
    `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` and the built about page.
  - `deploy.yml` on pushes to `main` and by hand: `build` (the Pages build) → `media` (a
    plain `ubuntu-24.04` runner with Playwright's Chromium and ffmpeg: a build for `/`
    served by `vite preview`, the scripted scenes of `tools/media/`, budgets from
    `tools/media/budgets.json`, a request log that fails on any other origin) → `pages`
    (the site with the media under `media/`, uploaded with
    `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3`) → `deploy` (`actions/deploy-pages@v4`,
    `environment: github-pages`, `concurrency: pages`). Until the first release creates
    `main` it is dispatched from `develop`; afterwards it deploys `main` only (ADR-0017 §7).
  - `release.yml` when `apps/web/package.json` changes on `main` (ADR-0017 §3): reads the
    version, builds the app for `/` and the media, creates the tag `v<version>` on that
    commit if it is missing, and publishes one GitHub Release with
    `recto-<version>-dist.zip` (for self-hosting), `recto-<version>-media.zip` and
    `SHA256SUMS`. Notes come from `.github/release-notes.md` (Highlights and Known
    limitations by hand) and the CHANGELOG sections (Added, Changed, Fixed); versions with
    a pre-release part are marked pre-release.
  - `qpdf-wasm.yml` rebuilds `qpdf.wasm` from pinned sources and fails when the committed
    artifact differs (ADR-0008).
- **Media** (presentation spec §2.6) are never committed: they are built by the deploy
  workflow, served from the site (`https://erendenizk.github.io/recto/media/<id>.gif` for
  the README), excluded from the precache (`media/**` in Workbox `globIgnores`) and zipped
  onto each release as its archive.
- PWA via `vite-plugin-pwa` (migrate to `@vite-pwa/core` when stable):
  `registerType: 'prompt'`; multi-megabyte WASM excluded from precache and cached at
  runtime (CacheFirst) so first paint never waits on an engine download. The OCR files
  (`ocr/**`: tesseract's worker, cores and ~22 MB of language packs) are never precached
  and live in their own `pdf-editor-ocr` CacheFirst cache, filled on first use or by
  "Keep available offline" (ADR-0012).
- Strict CSP in a `<meta>` tag, the same on the app and the about page: `default-src
  'self'`, `connect-src 'self'`, `worker-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'
  'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, `object-src 'none'`, `form-action 'none'`. Directives that only work as
  a response header are left out: browsers ignore `frame-ancestors` (and `sandbox`,
  `report-uri`) in a `<meta>` policy and log a console error on every load, and GitHub Pages
  cannot set response headers (ADR-0004), so the deploy has no way to forbid framing. A custom
  domain behind a CDN that can add headers would carry `frame-ancestors 'none'` there. The
  privacy indicator in
  the status bar reads the live `PerformanceObserver` resource list to display "No external
  requests" (it cannot see WebSocket frames or requests the CSP blocked).
- Cross-origin isolation (`coi-serviceworker`) is **not** used in v1; it is a documented
  progressive enhancement if a threaded component is ever added (ADR-0004).

## 8. Testing strategy

- Unit tests (Vitest 5) for the virtual document model, history, reconciliation logic.
- **Engine tests in Vitest Browser Mode** (real WASM, workers, OPFS) against a curated
  corpus in `test/fixtures/` (see `ROADMAP.md`, M0): tagged PDFs, forms with colliding
  names, outlines with named destinations, page labels, encrypted (RC4/AES-128/AES-256),
  broken xref, XFA, Type3 fonts, CCITT/JBIG2/JPX scans, huge page counts.
- **Golden-file tests**: every structural operation's output is re-parsed by a second
  parser and compared (page count, sizes, outline titles, field names, label strings,
  extracted text).
- **Redaction forensic tests**: raw byte grep + text extraction under every redaction.
- Playwright (1.63) end-to-end with screenshot comparison of rendered pages, baselines
  generated in the CI Docker image only.
- Lighthouse CI budget on total JS+WASM bytes and interaction latency.

## 9. Browser support

Chromium 125+, Firefox current and ESR, Safari 18+. Desktop-first; the layout must not
break on tablets, but touch-optimized interaction is a v2 item. Firefox and Safari lack
the File System Access API; saving there uses OPFS + download link. Safari has no
`getAsFileSystemHandle`; folder drops degrade to file drops.
