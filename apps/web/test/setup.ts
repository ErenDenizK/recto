// Shared setup for component tests (Vitest browser mode).
// - Registers the jest-dom matchers (`toBeVisible`, `toHaveAccessibleName`, ...) on
//   Vitest's `expect`, including their types.
// - Unmounts React trees rendered with @testing-library/react after every test, since
//   Vitest globals are off and automatic cleanup therefore does not register itself.
// - Forgets the remembered reading position before every test. Browser mode runs every
//   test file in a same-origin iframe of one browser, so they share one localStorage; a
//   file that leaves a fixture remembered at a later page would otherwise make the next
//   file's Read view open there, with page 1 off screen and its annotation layer unloaded.
// - Clears Recents (IndexedDB) before every test for the same reason.
// - Turns session snapshots off (OPFS is shared by every file too); session tests turn them on.
