/**
 * Pen bursts (experience-redesign spec §6.4): many strokes, one annotation. A word or a line
 * written in one go becomes one Ink annotation with many paths, one Review row and one undo
 * step, instead of one annotation per stroke.
 *
 * **Joining.** A stroke joins the open burst when (1) it is on the same page of the same
 * document, with the same preset; (2) the pause from the burst's last pointer-up to this
 * stroke's pointer-down is at most `INK_BURST_PAUSE_MS`; (3) the horizontal gap between this
 * stroke's bounds and the burst's bounds (centre lines, page space, so zoom does not change
 * it) is at most `INK_BURST_GAP_PT`; (4) it is on the line of the burst's last stroke
 * (`onBurstLine`): their vertical bands overlap by at least `INK_BURST_LINE_OVERLAP` of the
 * smaller band, or, when they do not overlap at all, the gap between them is at most
 * `INK_BURST_LINE_GAP` times the burst's median stroke height (a dot or a bar just above or
 * below joins; the next line of writing does not); and (5) the burst has fewer than
 * `INK_BURST_MAX_PATHS` paths. The pause and the gap can be overridden in the stored pen
 * settings (`burstPauseMs`, `burstGapPt`, no UI). The first stroke creates the Ink; each
 * joining stroke appends a path (with its widths) through `annotation.update`
 * (`appendInkPath`).
 *
 * **One undo step.** The create and every append carry the burst's `coalesceKey`
 * (`ink-burst:<uuid>`), so the history replaces its present entry instead of pushing a new
 * one, and the label follows the count ("Pen on page 1 · 5 strokes"). The history's own
 * 800 ms window would split a burst whose strokes are seconds apart, so the burst passes its
 * own window (`BURST_HISTORY_WINDOW_MS`, unbounded): the join rule above decides, and a key
 * is never reused, so nothing else can join the entry.
 *
 * **Undo inside a burst.** While a burst of several strokes is open and its entry is the
 * present one, Mod+Z removes its last stroke only (`undoBurstStroke`, `removeLastInkPath`):
 * the entry shrinks by one path and keeps its key, so the burst stays open and a rewritten
 * stroke joins it again. With one stroke left Mod+Z is the ordinary undo, which removes the
 * Ink and closes the burst.
 *
 * **Closing.** A burst closes when the pause passes (a timer from the last pointer-up,
 * stopped by the next press), on a tool or group change, Esc, a selection, a preset arm or
 * edit, a document change, window blur, and whenever the present history entry is no longer
 * the burst's (undo, redo, any other edit). A stroke on another page, after the pause, too far
 * away or past the path limit starts a new burst. Closing a burst of several strokes says so
 * once ("Pen: 5 strokes on page 1", spec §10); single strokes are announced by their create.
 * A stroke whose append was still queued when the history moved (an undo right after it) is
 * not saved and does not start a burst of its own: the layer says "Stroke not saved".
 *
 * **Cheaper appends** (craft spec §5.3 item 8). The open burst keeps its ink as the engine
 * last wrote it (`KnownInk`, from the create and from each append), so an append does not list
 * the page while that copy is current; the engine appends the path in place, the annotation
 * store takes the written ink without reloading, and the page repaints only the new path's
 * box (`actions.appendInkPath`). One burst lists the page once, for its create.
