/**
 * Straight pen lines (craft spec §5.6; research 12 §7): hold to straighten, and Shift.
 *
 * - **Hold to straighten.** While a stroke is drawn, a pointer that stays within
 *   `HOLD_STRAIGHTEN_PX` of one spot for `HOLD_STRAIGHTEN_MS` turns the stroke into a straight
 *   line from its first point to the pointer; the line follows the pointer until release and
 *   is handed over as two points. A press held still before the pointer has moved does not
 *   count (there is no stroke to straighten yet). `HoldStill` is the timing rule; the input
 *   pipeline (`ink-input.ts`) feeds it samples and asks it when the hold is due.
 * - **The cue.** When the line snaps it is drawn 1 px thicker for 120 ms, a visual cue in
 *   place of a haptic one; none under reduced motion.
 * - **Shift.** A straight line whose end snaps to the nearest multiple of 45° (horizontal,
 *   vertical or diagonal), in the preview as in the commit (`snapAngle`). With the
 *   Highlighter such a line over text becomes a Highlight by the usual rule (`highlighter.ts`).
