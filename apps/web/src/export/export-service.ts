/**
 * Export pipeline (ARCHITECTURE.md §4): virtual document → verified PDF bytes.
 *
 * 1. Plan (`planExport`, engine package): label ranges only when needed, outline without
 *    unresolved leaves, the verification expectation.
 * 2. Source bytes: sources with engine edits (the workspace store's `dirtySources` when it
 *    has one, and sources with `workspace.engineEdits`), encrypted sources (pdf-lib cannot
 *    read them without their password; security is removed) and sources PDFium repaired on
 *    open (the original bytes still carry the broken structure; ARCHITECTURE.md §5) go
 *    through `PdfEditor.save()`; so does every source when annotations are flattened or
 *    comments are left out (spec viewer-annotations.md §6), because those options change
 *    unedited sources too. The rest use the original bytes the engine service kept at
 *    open. Removals and repairs are reported (`sourceNotes`, and a report warning), never
 *    silent (ARCHITECTURE.md §5). Before saving, the annotations of every exported page of
 *    an edited source are counted (`listAnnotations`) for verification.
 *    Sources with text edits (`text.edit`) are always saved by PDFium and then finalized
 *    (`finalizeTextEdits`: `/Untitled` subset fonts renamed, repeated MCIDs repaired,
 *    unreachable objects dropped; ADR-0011 §5) right where their edited bytes are produced,
 *    so the assembler only ever sees finalized bytes. Sources with image edits (`image.*`) or
 *    OCR runs (`ocr.apply`, whose re-runs orphan the layer they replace) get the garbage
 *    collection alone (`finalizeContentEdits`). Sources with applied redactions
 *    (`plan.redaction`) are always saved by PDFium too: the engine holds their redacted
 *    document, never the original bytes kept at open.
 *    Content edits (text, image, redaction, OCR) are read from the edits the engine holds
 *    (`appliedEdits`), not from the history: the export fails when the two differ (a replay
 *    the engine refused; the edit runner's `runExclusive` refuses first), and the summary's
 *    text-edit counts, per source and by font outcome, are those of the saved bytes.
 * 3. Assemble in the assembly worker, with progress. Image pages take their bytes from the
 *    workspace store's blobs (PNG or JPEG; WebP was re-encoded to PNG when inserted). The
 *    assembler always writes a new file (pdf-lib `copyPages`): there is no incremental or
 *    byte-preserving path, which a redacted export must never take (spec §5.3).
 * 4. Verify: re-open the output in PDFium (and pdf-lib via the inspector; with the user
 *    password when the output is encrypted) and compare page count, sizes, rotations,
 *    labels and outline; with edited annotations also the annotation count per page and
 *    the annotation conformance rules for the annotations this app wrote. With applied
 *    redactions, the redaction self-check (`verifyRedactedOutput` in the PDFium worker) runs
 *    on the exact final bytes (after assembly, compression and encryption, with the user
 *    password) against every plan mapped to output pages; a failing check fails
 *    verification with the check's findings. Pages with OCR layers (`ocr.apply`) must
 *    yield their recognised words through PDFium (`ocrWords`, spec recognize-and-compare
 *    §1.3), read from the payloads the engine holds and mapped to output pages
 *    (`ocrWordsExpectation`). Only verified bytes are offered.
 *
 * 5. Signatures (spec recognize-and-compare §3.2, ADR-0013): the assembler writes a new
 *    file, so a signed source's signatures could not survive; `stripSignatures` removes their
 *    values before assembly (reported in `signaturesRemoved`). With `sign`, the last step
 *    signs a copy of the verified bytes in a dedicated signature worker (PAdES-B approval
 *    signature, one incremental section; refused for encrypted outputs), re-opens the signed
 *    bytes in PDFium (and re-runs the redaction self-check when there is one), and the worker
 *    is terminated; only then are the signed bytes offered, with the signature in the summary.
 *
 * 6. The file as it is (PLAN D1-3, V1-F12; ADR-0032 §5.3, Save while locked): a document that
 *    is still exactly the file it was opened from (`asOpened`: the same parts, pages in
 *    order, no engine edit) and an export that asks for nothing new (no password, size,
 *    compatibility, flattening, comments left out or signing) hands out the file's own bytes,
 *    byte for byte, after the same PDFium re-open check. Nothing is rewritten, so a signed
 *    file keeps its signatures and a locked document's copy is its file.
 *
 * Order for an edited, redacted source: engine save (annotation and form post-passes) →
 * `finalizeTextEdits` → signature values removed → assembly (and encryption) → compression →
 * PDFium verification → redaction self-check → signing → PDFium re-open (and self-check).
 *
 * Never rejects: failures resolve to `{ ok: false }` with a message fit for the UI.
