/**
 * Workspace state: the document model (`@pdf-editor/document-model`, ADR-0005) is the
 * source of truth. The store holds the undo `History`; `workspace` is always
 * `history.present.workspace`. Every mutating action pushes a labelled history entry.
 *
 * Next to the model, the store keeps UI facts the model deliberately does not carry: the
 * original file facts (size, modified date) and the colour tag assigned per source and per
 * document (light-table spec §1). These never change once assigned, so they live outside
 * history.
 *
 * Engine lifetime: a source stays open in the PDFium worker while any history entry
 * references it (undo can bring it back); it is closed once history no longer does. Image
 * blobs (image pages) follow the same rule: the model references them by `BlobId`, the
 * bytes live here, and they are released once no history entry references them.
 *
 * Composed operations (`applyComposed`) run an async prelude first (open files in the
 * engine, decode images, ask the user something) and then commit one model operation as a
 * single history entry: dropping a PDF onto a section is one undo step, not "open" plus
 * "insert".
 *
 * Work in progress: a source opened or a blob stored by an operation that has not
 * committed yet is in no history entry, so garbage collection (run by every commit,
 * including other operations' commits) would drop it. The operation that creates it owns
 * a `ProtectionLease`; `loadSources` and `addBlob` protect each id they create under the
 * caller's lease the moment it exists, and only that lease's `release()` lifts it. The
 * protections are reference counts, so one operation finishing never unprotects what
 * another one is still preparing.
 *
 * Lock (ADR-0030 §2.5, PLAN D1-3): `commit()` refuses any change to a locked document
 * (`lock-check.ts`), and `replacePresent` likewise; Undo, Redo, History jumps and a session
 * restore (`replaceHistory`) move between recorded states and never ask.
