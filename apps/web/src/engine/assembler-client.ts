/**
 * The app's assembly worker (pdf-lib): assembles exports and inspects sources for the
 * PDFium adapter (page labels, /Lang). One long-lived worker, created on first use.
 *
 * Vite's `?worker` import bundles the engine's worker entry as a same-origin module worker
 * (`worker.format: 'es'`), which the CSP allows (`worker-src 'self'`). A bare specifier in
 * `new URL(…, import.meta.url)` is not resolved by Vite, so the documented `?worker` form is
 * used. The proxy comes from the light client entry (PF-2), loaded lazily so it stays out of
 * the entry chunk.
