# @pdf-editor/engine

Engine contracts (`types.ts`) and their adapters. UI code depends only on the interfaces
(ADR-0002); nothing here loads anything from a CDN.

| Adapter | Implements | Engine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PdfiumAdapter` | `PdfRenderer`, `PdfEditor`, `PdfVerifier` | PDFium via `@embedpdf/engines` 2.x |
| `PdfLibAssembler` | `PdfAssembler` | `@cantoo/pdf-lib` |
| `createAssemblerProxy(worker)` | `PdfAssembler` | `PdfLibAssembler` in a Worker via Comlink |

## PDFium (render, text, annotations, forms, redaction, verification)

```ts
import wasmUrl from '@embedpdf/pdfium/pdfium.wasm?url'; // app code: Vite-specific import
import { PdfiumAdapter } from '@pdf-editor/engine';

const pdfium = new PdfiumAdapter({ wasmUrl });
const doc = await pdfium.open(sourceId, bytes, { password });
const { bitmap } = await pdfium.renderPage(sourceId, 0, { scale: devicePixelRatio });
```

- **wasm URL**: injected by the app. Use the package export `@embedpdf/pdfium/pdfium.wasm`
  (`dist/pdfium.wasm` is not in the package's `exports` map). The app runs the engine in
  this package's own worker (`@pdf-editor/engine/pdfium.worker` behind `createPdfiumProxy`,
  ADR-0011), a same-origin module worker: the CSP needs only `worker-src 'self'` and
  `connect-src 'self'` for the wasm fetch. The default `engineFactory` (EmbedPDF's own
  worker, used when no factory is passed) runs from a `blob:` URL and would also need
  `worker-src blob:`; it is loaded lazily and stays out of the app bundle.
- **Font fallback is off by default** (`fontFallback: null`). EmbedPDF's default would fetch
  fonts from cdn.jsdelivr.net, which this project never does. To enable fallback, host the
  fonts yourself and pass a `FontFallbackConfig` (`FontCharset` is re-exported), e.g.
  `{ baseUrl: '/fonts/', fonts: { [FontCharset.SHIFTJIS]: 'NotoSansJP-Regular.otf' } }`.
  The config is posted to the worker, so use URLs, not a `fontLoader` function.
- The engine starts lazily on the first call; `destroy()` terminates its worker.
- **Page labels and /Lang**: EmbedPDF has no API for them (PDFium's `FPDF_GetPageLabel` is
  exported by `@embedpdf/pdfium` but not through the `PdfEngine` interface). Pass an
  `inspector` (the assembler proxy, or a `PdfLibAssembler`): `open` then inspects a copy of
  the bytes with pdf-lib in parallel and fills `pages[].label` and `metadata.language`.
- **`flags.repaired`**: PDFium and pdf-lib repair silently, so `open` runs
  `checkXrefStructure` (pure, header + tail + xref sections only): header at byte 0,
  `startxref` → `xref` table with a trailer or an xref stream, valid `/Prev` chain, sampled
  entry offsets. Any failure means the reader reconstructed the file.
- **Outline facts**: EmbedPDF drops the /Count sign and reports null /XYZ parameters as 0.
  With an inspector, `open` reads both with pdf-lib and merges them into
  `OpenedDocument.outline` (`open`, and `left`/`top` kept when they are exactly 0). Without
  one, every node is closed and a 0 coordinate reads as "keep current".
- **Pages** carry `cropBox` (user space). Glyph rects, search hits, annotation rects and
  render clips are absolute user space; subtract the CropBox origin to place them on the
  rendered page.
- **Search** streams: `search(id, q, { onProgress })` is called per page as PDFium finishes
  it; hits carry `matchStart`/`matchLength` into `context`.
- **Verification** (`verify`) checks page count and sizes, and optionally rotations,
  outline count/titles, page labels (needs the inspector), form field names, annotation
  counts per page (`annotationCounts`, links excluded) and annotation conformance
  (`checkAnnotations`, optionally scoped to `annotationIds`).
- All geometry is PDF user space (unrotated, origin bottom-left). `renderPage` returns a
  fresh `ImageBitmap`; if you put the adapter behind Comlink, transfer the bitmap.
- Every call accepts an `AbortSignal`; aborting rejects with `EngineError('aborted')`.

## Assembly (virtual document → bytes)

```ts
import { createAssemblerProxy } from '@pdf-editor/engine';
import AssemblerWorker from '@pdf-editor/engine/assembler.worker?worker'; // Vite, app code

const assembler = createAssemblerProxy(new AssemblerWorker());
const { bytes, report } = await assembler.assemble({ document, sources, blobs }, { signal });
```

Source and blob `ArrayBuffer`s are transferred to the worker (detached for the caller).
`assembler.inspect(bytes)` / `getPageLabels(bytes)` read labels and /Lang in the same worker.

`planExport(workspace, documentId)` derives the assembly document (label ranges via
`deriveLabelRanges` only when `needsPageLabels`, outline via `dropUnresolved`), the source
names used for form namespaces, and the `VerificationExpectation` for the output. The
assembler writes exactly the labels it is given. Reconciliation covers: outlines (explicit
and named destinations resolved on open), links (explicit and named, rewritten or dropped
and counted), AcroForm (`namespace-by-source`, `rename-collisions`, `unify-same-name`),
/PageLabels, structure tree removal, XFA removal, fresh /ID and XMP, /Lang passthrough.
Metadata (`pdflib/metadata.ts`): Info with custom keys mirrored in XMP (`pdfx:`), the
sources' embedded files carried over, and `DocumentMetadata.strip` applied to the output
(removed objects are dropped, not just unlinked; the report's `metadataStripped` counts
them). AES-256 without an owner password gets a random one, so restrictions hold.
`diagnose()` (`pdflib/metadata-diagnostics.ts`) reports version, encryption, fonts, images
(approximate DPI from the first direct placement), annotations and strip findings.
`PdfLibAssembler` can also be used directly on the main thread.

Overlay placement: anchors and offsets refer to the visible page (CropBox after /Rotate);
`offset` is in points, +x right, +y up. Text overlays use the standard 14 fonts until M3.

## Annotations (M2)

`PdfiumAdapter` implements every kind of spec viewer-annotations.md §3 through EmbedPDF,
plus a pdf-lib post-pass in `save()` (`annotations/finalize.ts`) for what EmbedPDF leaves
out. Geometry is PDF user space; quads, ink points and vertices survive create → list →
save → re-open → list within 0.01 pt (tests: `test/annotations.test.ts`).

| Kind | Create / update / delete | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| highlight, underline, strikeout, squiggly | native | Highlights get a Multiply blend. Fewer quads on update = delete + recreate with the same id. |
| ink | native | /Rect derived from the paths plus half the stroke width. |
| square, circle | native | |
| line, polygon, polyline | native | `lineEndings` → /LE (arrow = `open-arrow`); /Rect derived from the vertices. |
| free-text | native + embedded font (M2-a) | WinAnsi text: standard-14 Helvetica/Times/Courier with WinAnsi encoding (PDFium generates the /AP and declares the font in its resources; the font is not embedded). Text outside WinAnsi (e.g. Turkish ğ ı ş İ): the adapter replaces PDFium's appearance (which leaves those characters out) with one set in the bundled family closest to the standard font (Inter, Noto Serif, JetBrains Mono) as an embedded subset with ToUnicode, under the /DA font name (`annotations/free-text-appearance.ts`, `EPDFAnnot_SetAppearanceFromPage`); rewritten after every update. Characters the bundled faces lack are refused with `EngineError('unsupported')`. |
| text (note) | native + post-pass | Icon, contents, color native. Popup (/Popup ↔ /Parent) and open state (/Open) written by `save()`; `open` is kept by the adapter until then and read back from the popup on open (inspector). |
| stamp (image) | native + post-pass | PNG, JPEG, or a one-page PDF appearance (`getAnnotationAppearance` returns one, used to recreate deleted stamps). Opacity (/CA + ExtGState wrapper) is written by `save()`; PDFium's live render shows the stamp opaque until then. A new image = delete + recreate with the same id. |
| stamp (named) | generated appearance | `name` in `STAMP_NAMES` (Approved, Draft, Confidential, ...) without an image gets a text-only appearance generated with pdf-lib (`annotations/stamp-appearance.ts`). Other names: `EngineError('unsupported')`. |
| link | native (read-only use) | Listed with `uri` / `targetPageIndex`. Created links get EmbedPDF's default underline border. |
| popup | not listed | Belongs to its parent (`NoteAnnotation.open`). |

What `save()` adds (post-pass, runs in the assembly worker when the inspector offers
`finalizeAnnotations`):

- `/P` on every annotation (PDFium writes none) — conformance failure in EmbedPDF's output.
- `/M` is always passed to EmbedPDF (PDFium writes it only when given); `/F` Print forced
  on annotations created or updated in this session.
- Popups for notes and for commented markup (unless `includeComments: false`, which removes
  every popup); orphan popups of deleted notes are removed. EmbedPDF has no popup support.
- Stamp opacity (EmbedPDF writes no /CA for stamps).

EmbedPDF's own output was otherwise conformant: /AP with an ExtGState carrying CA/ca when
opacity < 1, QuadPoints in UL, UR, LL, LR order, /Rect = appearance BBox.

Other EmbedPDF 2.15 quirks handled here: annotation and widget rects are read back with the
unrotated size at a rotated corner on /Rotate 90/180/270 pages (`annotationRectToUser`);
an update merges into the existing object, so absent `contents`/`author` are written as
empty (updates carry the full state).

`flattenAnnotations` bakes every annotation except links and popups. Saving annotation
edits into an encrypted document requires `removeSecurity` (pdf-lib would write the post-
pass output unencrypted); export always removes and re-applies security.

### Ids (/NM) and the edit log

`createAnnotation({ ..., id })` creates the annotation with that /NM (EmbedPDF honours a
supplied id; duplicates on the page are refused). `edits/` builds on it:
`applyEngineEdit(editor, edit)` applies an `EngineEdit` (annotation create/update/delete,
form set-value) and returns its inverse (whose `inverse` is the applied edit, for redo);
`applyEngineEditWithResult` also returns the applied edit with the engine-assigned id filled
in (record that one). `replayEngineEdits` re-applies a log on freshly opened sources (crash
recovery). Payloads are JSON (`edits/payloads.ts`; stamp images travel as base64).
Redaction edits are refused (`unsupported`) until M4.

### Conformance

`checkAnnotationConformance(bytes, { ids? })` (`annotations/conformance.ts`) checks what the
research (04-feature-feasibility.md §3) lists; rules and their exact reading are documented
in the file. The QA sample and matrix for real viewers live in `docs/qa/`.
